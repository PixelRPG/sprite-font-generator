# Sprite Font Generator

A straightforward tool designed to convert web fonts into sprite fonts. At present, it exclusively supports the [ark-pixel-font](https://github.com/TakWolf/ark-pixel-font). However, plans are underway to broaden its capabilities to encompass various web fonts in the near future.

## Development

> **Note on Development Tools**: Our project heavily relies on web development tools such as Node.js and Yarn. We operate under the assumption that contributors or users interacting with our codebase possess a foundational understanding of these tools. As such, we won't delve into detailed explanations or tutorials on their usage within this documentation. If you're unfamiliar with them, we recommend seeking external resources or tutorials to get up to speed.

```

### Production Build

Compile and prepare the project for a production environment:

```shell
